# Assignment 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Introduction

Our group will be exploring the "[Traffic Crashes - Crashes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if)" dataset, which provides insights into various traffic accidents within the city limits of Chicago.

The exploration is organized into two distinct notebooks/parts, as detailed in the tasks based from [this link](https://fmiranda.me/courses/cs424-fall-2023/assignment-2/):
- **Part 1**: This notebook is dedicated focus to Task 1, where we will load, profile, and cleanse the data. Upon completion, the refined data will be saved to ensure a smooth transition into the next part.
- **Part 2**: With the curated data from Part 1 at our disposal, this notebook will delve into Task 2, focusing on data visualizations and in-depth analytics.

## Dataset
The dataset is from the City of Chicago, which contains
data on motor vehicle crashes in Chicago. It provides 
crash details, severity, causes, involved parties, 
vehicle information, and traffic controls. It contains more than 770K rows and 49 columns with many missing values.

## Implemented Visualizations
For question 1, we chose our sketch #1, #2 and #4, which is
a calender heatmap that tracks the number of crashes 
in each day of the month, a stacked area chart that tells
us how injuries changed over time, and a double-time bar
graph that splits the time between day and night.

For question 3, we chose our sketch #1, which is a grouped bar
chart that incorporates the number of different injuries is depended
on the conditions out of the drivers control.

For question 2, we chose our sketch #3, which is a chloropeth map
that shows the crashes throughout the hour.

For question 4, we chose our sketch #1, which is a heatmap
that shows the correlation between the primary and secondary
causes.

## Derived Insight
For question 1 sketch #1, we can see that the month of May 
has the most crashes overall.

For question 1 sketch #2, we can see  peaks in crashes in 2018, 
2019, and 2020, along with the dip during COVID-19. 

For question 1 sketch #4, we can observe that there is a higher number
of crashes in the day rather than at night.

For question 3, sketch #1, we can observe that most injuries occur in normal conditions.

For question 2, sketch #2, the most crashes occur near Midway and near downtown.

For question 4, sketch #1, we can see that most of it is unknown.
